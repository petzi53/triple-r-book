Welcome Peter! 

This is my personal minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

This template provides a skeleton file structure to create a new bookdown project with all my changes and additions. 

The the folder "test-old-stuff" contains some .Rmd files from the original minimal example. They provide some pointers to help you get started, but feel free to delete the content in each file or the complete folder. Also change the content of this file to your new README text for the nwe project.

## ToDo list for a new bookdown project

- Copy folder "Meine-Repos/BOOKDOWN TEMPLATE/bookdown-template-book" to "Meine-Repos/"
- Change folder name "bookdown-template-book" to Repo name
- Change .Rproj file to repo name
- Open project via RStudio
- Open file `_output.yml` and replaces "HERE INSERT THE BOOK NAME" with the book name
- Change the GitHub address to the new repo
- Change the title in index.Rmd
- Check "options" and" knitr::opts_chunk" in `_common.R`.
- Check `CTRL-B` to a first test compilation of the book 
- Commit you first commit
- Type in the console: `usethis::use_github()`

VOILÃ€: The bookdown project with all my changes is local and online working
